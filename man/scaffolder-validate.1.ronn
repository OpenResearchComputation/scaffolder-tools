scaffolder-validate(1) -- Test scaffold for overlapping inserts
===============================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`scaffolder validate` <scaffolder-file> <sequence-file>

## DESCRIPTION

**Scaffolder-validate** examines the **scaffolder-file** to detect overlapping
sequence inserts. Overlapping sequence inserts may lead to unexpected sequence
output in generated scaffold sequence and should be avoided.  A list of any
overlapping inserts is returned in a yaml format.

## EXAMPLES

    $ scaffolder-validate scaffold.yml sequences.fna > overlapping_inserts.yml

## BUGS

**Scaffolder-validate** is written in Ruby and depends on the scaffolder,
BioRuby and configliere gems. See the Gemfile in the scaffolder-tools gem
install directory for version details.

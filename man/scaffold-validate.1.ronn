`scaffold-validate` <scaffold-file> <sequence-file>

## DESCRIPTION

output for the scaffold when and should be avoided.  A list of any overlapping
inserts is returned in a yaml format.

## EXAMPLES

    $ scaffold-validate scaffold.yml sequences.fna > overlapping_inserts.yml

## BUGS

**Scaffold-validate** is written in Ruby and depends on the scaffolder, BioRuby
and configliere gems. See the Gemfile in the scaffolder-tools gem install
directory for version details.
